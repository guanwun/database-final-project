Our app is a hybrid app that is written in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, but compiled into an app using Adobe's PhoneGap.
PhoneGap inserts a few of their own files, including cordova, when the app is compiled.
These files allow it to behave as an app, accessing native features of the phone like notifications.

The two main files are index.html and medapp.js. 

index.html creates the html structure. 
MedicationListTable is the table seen in the homescreen, which lists the medications along with buttons to view info, edit, and delete.
AddMedicationWindow is a window that pops up when the + button is clicked, displaying a blank table for adding a new medication.
EditMedicationWindow is similar to AddMedicationWindow, but it will fill in automatically with the existing prescriptions's information, and update that prescriptions's row.
MedicationInfoWindow is a popup that displays all of the information about the given perscription.

medapp.js is the main JavaScript file, where all of the behind-the-scenes work happens.
It creates the database and tables (if they don't exist), runs the SQL commands to edit them, schedules notifications, etc.
It begins by creating and filling the database tables, and initializing popups and buttons.
fillDialog fills a popup with information from the database, and clear deletes it for a clean slate the next time a popup is opened.
handleInput takes the information received in a popup window and decides what to do with it.
addMedToDatabase, editMedInDatabase, and deleteMedFromDatabase are used to add, edit, and delete a prescription from the database.
addMedToTable, editMedInTable, and deleteMedInTable are used to update the homescreen table that the user sees.
addNewNotification, editNotification, and deleteNotifcation are used to add, edit, and delete notifications using PhoneGap's cordova.
